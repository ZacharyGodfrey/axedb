## Disciplines

(card

IATF axe throwing has two tools (Hatchet and Big Axe) that are thrown at two targets (Bullseye and Clutch). The combination of these factors creates four distinct disciplines. A well-rounded competitor will develop their skills in each of these four disciplines:

- Hatchet Bullseye
- Hatchet Clutch
- Big Axe Bullseye
- Big Axe Clutch

## Metrics

(card

Accuracy could be measured with a number of different metrics, but AxeDB focuses primarily on Score Per Axe (SPA). The more accurate a throw is, the higher its score will be; and the more consistently accurate a competitor is, the higher their average Score Per Axe will be.

## Ranking

(card

AxeDB calculates each competitor's Score Per Axe at the round, match, week, season, and career levels for each of the four disciplines as well as an overall Score Per Axe that collapses their entire performance into a single number for comparison with other competitors.

The competitors are ranked by career overall Score Per Axe, so if you're trying to move up the rankings then just focus on improving your accuracy in each of the four disciplines.
