## About

(card

Hey, I'm Zach, the creator of AxeDB. In the IATF, I throw under the alias [REDACTED](/1207260).

I built this website for those competitors like me who are focused on the continual refinement of their accuracy.

[AxeScores](https://axescores.com) is a great website, and they are still the source of truth for all IATF throwing data, but they seem primarily concerned with showing wins and losses while I care more about tracking my accuracy over time.

I hope that what I've built here will be useful to the IATF community.
