# ThrowDB

A custom scrape of my own IATF axe throwing data

---

The purpose of this project is to scrape my AxeScores data to build a custom dashboard where I can see my accuracy progression over time.

I will only be scraping Premier throwing data, as it's the only ruleset used for major tournaments.

Once scraped and mapped, the data will be aggregated and used to build a static web page with any visualizations I want to view.
